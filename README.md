# Fivem Roleplay Framework

A framework i created in 2020 sometime, though that if anyone wants to use it or any of it´s components, it´s up for grabs.

Right now this is created using ghmattisql for database queries. There is currently no plans to include database/table creation instructions, but this could be added if there is interest for it.

The project is triggering events from other resources that are not included in this repository, you will need to either implement your own menus, vehiclehandler and so on, or simply remove the code associated. The code left in there are mainly examples left behind for how i did it, use it as inspiration of how things could be achieved if you want.

If you have no experience with LUA, this will not function as a plug-and-play resource, you will need to change things in the code to make it function as you want it to. I might make this easier in the future if there is any interest.

### Dependencies

- Any script made to handle database queries, E.g. ghmattisql, mysql-async, oxmysql and so on.

### Installing

- Clone the repository and have fun
